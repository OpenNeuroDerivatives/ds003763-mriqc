    "Instructions": "The Heart/Sound phase was indicated on the screen by an ECG/note symbol, and at the start of the response phase a finger on a button pictogram appeared nearby. During the Heart condition, participants were asked to listen to their own heartbeat and, during the response phase, to press a button each time they felt a heartbeat. During the Sound task, 'beep' tones were presented at the individual rate of heartbeats with a similar random variance. Before the task, the level of sound was individually adjusted to the minimum that the participant was able to discriminate from the noise of the scanner. The participants were instructed to attend to the tones and, during the response phase, to press a button each time they heard a tone. Instructions were first presented as a video clip outside of the scanner, and then presented inside the scanner.",
